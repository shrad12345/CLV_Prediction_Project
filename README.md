# CLV_Prediction_Project
This project predicts Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) using Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) metrics. Customers are segmented into clusters, and an XGBoost model is trained to predict future CLV. The goal is to provide insights for targeted marketing and customer retention.
